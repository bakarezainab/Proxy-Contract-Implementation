# Transparent Proxy Pattern Implementation

This repository contains a simplified implementation of the Transparent Proxy Pattern for upgradeable smart contracts on Ethereum.

## Introduction to Proxy Patterns

Smart contracts on Ethereum are immutable by design - once deployed, their code cannot be modified. While this immutability is a security feature, it creates challenges for fixing bugs, adding features, or adapting to changing requirements.

Proxy patterns solve this problem by separating a contract's state from its logic through two contracts:
- **Proxy Contract**: Stores state and delegates calls to the implementation
- **Implementation Contract**: Contains the logic but doesn't store state

This separation allows developers to deploy new implementation contracts while maintaining the state and address of the proxy contract.

## The Transparent Proxy Pattern

### Overview

The Transparent Proxy Pattern, developed by OpenZeppelin, is one of the most widely adopted proxy patterns. It addresses the "function selector clash" problem that can occur in basic proxy implementations.

### Key Components

1. **Transparent Proxy**: Forwards calls to the implementation contract and includes logic to differentiate between admin and user calls
2. **Implementation Contract**: Contains the business logic
3. **ProxyAdmin**: A separate contract that handles administrative functions like upgrades

### How it Works

1. When a function call is made to the proxy:
   - If the caller is an admin address and the function is an admin function (e.g., upgrade), the proxy executes the function directly
   - Otherwise, the call is forwarded to the implementation contract

2. The proxy uses `delegatecall` to execute functions in the implementation contract, which allows the implementation's code to operate on the proxy's storage

3. The admin functions are handled separately to avoid function selector clashes between admin functions and implementation functions

### Storage Layout

The proxy follows a specific storage layout defined in EIP-1967:
